Our AI Opportunity Initiative comes to the Middle East and North Africa,https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-middle-east/ai-opportunity-initiative-middle-east-north-africa/,"The potential impact of AI on the Middle East and North Africa’s (MENA) economy is phenomenal — adding a value of over $320 billion by 2030, according to the Economist Impact Report. But in order to seize the opportunities of AI, we need to equip people with the right skills to grow. And to do this the right way, we believe in collaboration and working closely with organizations across the region to transform lives and communities for the better.
Last week, we launched the AI Opportunity Initiative for the Middle East & North Africa, its largest AI initiative in the region, that will provide essential AI skills, research funding and access to helpful AI products. Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, is planning to contribute US$15 million, between this year and the end of 2027, through funding to organizations across the region to ensure the opportunities created by AI reach everyone.
This initiative builds on our long-standing commitment to the region, where, together with local partners, we’ve trained 3 million people on essential digital skills since 2018. Through this new initiative, we aim to further empower half a million individuals within two years with critical AI skills.
As part of the AI Opportunity Initiative for MENA, we’re launching a new Arabic language AI-training curriculum under Google's digital skills program “Maharat min Google” and Coursera to equip people with AI skills like prompt engineering.
Because AI skills need to be accessible by underserved communities, Google.org is providing a grant to Village Capital to equip Business Support Organizations (BSOs) with skills and resources to train underserved workers on AI skills in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the UAE.
Earlier this year, we announced the launch of Experience AI, an educational program created by Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, covering AI literacy skills. The program is now available in Arabic. To ensure the program reaches more educators in the region, Raspberry Pi Foundation will use grant funding from Google.org to train teachers on AI Literacy, to equip their students in the region (aged 11-14 yrs) with AI safety skills to better understand and navigate the challenges of AI technologies. In the UAE and Saudi, this will be run in partnership with Amideast."
How we’re helping partners with improved and expanded AI-based flood forecasting,https://blog.google/technology/ai/expanding-flood-forecasting-coverage-helping-partners/,"Devastating floods cause tragic casualties, widespread displacement and immense financial loss every year. To help governments, NGOs, global organizations and vulnerable communities take action, we've worked on breakthrough AI research to provide accurate flood information and bolster climate resiliency. Our team at Google Research has pioneered scalable global flood forecasting models, published in Nature, that bring near real-time data to aid organizations and communities around the world.
Today, in line with our mission to use AI to make flood forecasting information globally accessible, we’re announcing a series of expansions. These announcements include:
These expansions will bring more information on riverine floods to millions of people across the globe, as well as more data to researchers and partners.
With this expansion of our AI-powered riverine flood forecasting model, we’re now covering more than 100 countries — up from 80. This enables us to provide critical flood information to 700 million people worldwide, a considerable leap from our previous reach of 460 million. This expansion is possible because of recent research advances that have made our model more accurate than ever before. These advances include using more labeled data, three times as many locations when training our models, a new model architecture that makes our model much more robust, and adding a new weather forecasting model as input to the flood forecasting model. Read more in our Research blog.
Now, more communities will have timely access to flood information, enhancing preparedness and response efforts for millions around the world, both through sharing information on Google Search and Google Maps, and our Google Flood Hub.
We are now making our breakthrough flood forecasting model forecasts, with improved accuracy, reliability, and coverage, available to researchers and partners via GRRR, and via an upcoming API.
Our new API pilot program — created with leading organizations — is now accepting signups to our waitlist so that partners can indicate their interest today. The API will give researchers and practitioners access to our hydrologic forecasts and the expected flood status, including data in areas where the availability of local data is limited, in order to accelerate flood research and response faster.
While our global hydrologic model is able to provide discharge predictions at any point on Earth, in Flood Hub we are only showing forecasts at points with gauges where we can verify the accuracy of the model using historical data from reliable sensors that measure streamflow. However, much of the world doesn’t have such reliable sensors. So we’re adding an additional data layer to Flood Hub by including 250,000 forecast points from our Flood Forecasting model using “virtual gauges.” This allows us to share additional flood forecasting information with researchers and experts in more than 150 countries — including countries where physical gauges are not available. This will help provide an additional layer of data for experts and researchers in locations that have not had access to reliable forecasts in the past."
7 pieces of AI news we announced in October,https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-ai-updates-october-2024/,"For more than 20 years, we’ve invested in machine learning and AI research, tools and infrastructure to build products that make everyday life better for more people. Teams across Google are working on ways to unlock AI’s benefits in fields as wide-ranging as healthcare, crisis response and education. To keep you posted on our progress, we're doing a regular roundup of Google's most recent AI news across products, research, and more. Here’s a look back at just some of our AI announcements from October."
Announcing the 2024 Google PhD Fellows,https://blog.google/technology/research/google-phd-fellowship-program-2024/,"It’s been 15 years since Google launched the PhD Fellowship Program to recognize and support outstanding graduate students pursuing exceptional research in computer science and related fields.
At Google, we firmly believe in the connection between scientific advancement and social impact. We’re committed to supporting PhD students’ fundamental research through funding and mentorship, and see it as vital to transforming the way we approach the toughest problems across foundational science. Over the past 15 years, Google’s PhD Fellowship Program has supported over 800 graduate students from over 210 universities in 53 countries across Africa, Australia, East Asia, Europe, India, Latin America, New Zealand, North America and Southeast Asia.
I'm thrilled the program has been able to champion PhD students at the forefront of scientific advancement around the globe. And today, I'm excited to announce the recipients of the 2024 Google PhD Fellowship program. See the complete list of Google PhD Fellowship recipients for 2024.
As we welcome the 2024 Google PhD Fellows, I also want to take a moment to reflect on the journeys of some of our earliest fellows. Our program fosters a vibrant community of scholars who have gone on to shape the landscape of computer science across academia, industry and entrepreneurship. Their experiences and accomplishments exemplify the impact that passionate researchers can have on technology and society. Here’s what nine Google PhD Fellows from the program’s first year had to say about their experiences."
"A golden age for research: broader scope, faster cycles, greater impact",https://blog.google/technology/research/what-is-google-research/,"We live in a golden age for research.
Never before have we had the opportunity to make such rapid advances in computer science, and apply them so quickly to global-scale challenges, in a way that can help people in their daily lives. Since the start of my career, I’ve been excited by the “magic cycle” of research, where real-world challenges motivate new foundational and applied research, which in turn has a positive impact in the real world. Today, with the right infrastructure, talent and approach, we’re able not only to make rapid breakthroughs in everything from AI to algorithms to computing infrastructure, but to put those technologies to work to improve people’s daily lives and have societal impact faster than ever before, sometimes in a matter of months.
I’m seeing this firsthand as I’ve recently stepped up to lead Google Research, so I wanted to share a perspective on the incredible progress we’re seeing — and how important research is in driving helpful innovation.
Google itself in fact began with research. “The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine,” published in 1998, explored how PageRank could provide a fundamentally better way to find info on the web, But it didn’t stop with a research paper — it was applying that research that produced Google. Over the past 26 years, that approach to implementing research — quickly — has transformed not only our company, but also how people can interact with the world’s information. Indeed, much of the rapid progress in AI we see all around us today grew from Google Research’s invention of the Transformer.
In all of our research, we ask ourselves: How can we make a step change, not just incremental? What’s impossible today, that we could make possible? And what is the greatest impact we can have — how can this make a real difference in the world?
Google Research today includes fundamental and applied work in foundational machine learning and algorithms, computing systems and quantum AI, and science, AI & societal impact. And across all these domains, we run initiatives on efficiency in machine learning, factuality & grounding in AI systems, and new data techniques.
We motivate our research by going after the biggest questions that matter to advance science and make a difference to people and to communities globally. What are the most effective ways to mitigate climate change? How can we help make billions of people healthier? How can we enable new experiences? And to do all this, can we break through limitations in computing and AI systems? Each of those becomes an inspiring research challenge — and in so many cases we’ve already translated research into solutions.
For example, to address climate change, in a trial with American Airlines we used AI to help reduce contrails by 54%, demonstrating that airlines can verifiably avoid contrails and thereby reduce their climate impact. To help address the growing wildfire crisis, we partnered with leading wildfire authorities to develop FireSat, an upcoming AI-powered global satellite constellation to detect and track wildfires the size of a classroom — within 20 minutes. And consider flood forecasting — when our team at Google Research began the project in 2018, experts I met with said it was likely impossible to forecast riverine floods. But by developing AI that can build a global hydrologic model, we’ve not only proven it’s possible, but applied it to provide communities accurate early warnings and help save lives.
Meanwhile, to support health and wellbeing, we’ve developed AI that can help screen for breast cancer and colorectal cancer, help prevent blindness at scale, spot potential skin conditions and detect diseases based on the sound of coughs. We’re still in the earliest days of AI breakthroughs and genomics research, and yet we’ve made progress with Large Language Models for the medical domain and we’re already poised to improve the health care for hundreds of millions of people.
But perhaps one of the biggest undertakings involves advancing computing itself, and how it can fundamentally alter the scope of problem-solving. We’ve developed state-of-the-art attention models and use graph mining to improve retrieval quality. We’re also working on approaches to grounding large language models, such as by training models to rely on source documents for summarization and evaluating factual consistency. This research has led to improvements like the double-check feature in the Gemini app. We’ve made AI more efficient with research on speculative decoding, efficient inference techniques, and cascades, and we’ve helped improve privacy with federated learning and differential privacy. And our quantum computing team just published new results in Nature affirming that as we reduce the error rate in our quantum processors, we reach levels of computation that can’t be matched by even the world’s most powerful classical computers — putting us on track to crack open an entirely new computational capability for the world.
These are just a few examples of the type of work done across Google Research.
Of course, as we turn research towards impact, we’re acutely aware that technology is not automatically beneficial — you can't ""invent it and forget it,"" simply releasing powerful technologies on the naive assumption that they will be helpful. It requires careful stewardship, partnership and a fundamentally human-centric view of how to design and guide emerging technologies. That’s one reason we do our research in partnership with a multitude of researchers in academia and many others, while creating tools and best practices that support a truly global research ecosystem with the aim of steering new technologies towards beneficial outcomes. We actively engage in advancing socio-technical research to bolster our AI principles — including on equitable datasets, interpretability, and algorithmic fairness — and there’s important work ahead to make our AI models even more efficient, factual, robust and safe.
We have the greatest impact when we’re working with research partners. Since 2005, Google has worked with more than 1,000 research institutions and invested over $400 million dollars in academic research worldwide, much of this led by Google Research. We find experts across disciplines, roll up our sleeves, dive into the research, and make scientific advances together. In our connectomics research, we’ve partnered with Harvard to use AI to make the most detailed mapping yet of neurons in the human brain, revealing newly discovered structures — all towards helping scientists understand fundamental processes such as thought, learning and memory. Google Research also engaged in a first-of-its-kind collaboration with Howard University and other HBCUs to build a high-quality African-American English (AAE) speech dataset that Google — and others — will use to improve speech products. This is related to our overall effort to reduce barriers and better serve communities by enabling technology to work in many more languages.
With our partners, and through Google’s own products, we use our research advances to benefit billions of people. For example, as populations swell and shift in the Global South, millions of people’s buildings aren’t represented on any map, and they risk missing out on essentials like electricity, healthcare and mail delivery. So Google Research in Africa has used AI to make big improvements to the Open Buildings dataset — transforming blurry, low-res satellite imagery into useful, high-res building outlines so partners like the World Bank, the World Resources Institute, UN Habitat, WorldPop and Sunbird AI can use it to ensure global development includes everyone. Along with our SKAI effort, this has helped our partnership with the UN to boost damage assessment.
In another sphere, our Operations Research team recently showed how cargo shippers could double their profit, deliver 13% more containers and use 15% fewer ships. This is not only helpful for businesses, but good for supply chains globally.
Finally, we of course partner extensively with product teams to drive innovation across Google — and our responsibility also includes keeping an eye on the horizon, exploring the art of the possible, and imagining how we can apply our breakthrough technologies for maximum benefit in years to come.
We feel great urgency given the scope of problems facing humanity — but also great optimism because of what we’ve been able to do already. Our multi-decade track record shows that Google Research is second-to-none in delivering helpful advances. We’ve delivered breakthroughs that have shaped Google's identity as a company, helped inaugurate new fields in computer science, and advanced the frontiers of innovation and technology with thousands of publications. The advances we’ve shared are already assisting people – from their everyday tasks, to their most ambitious and imaginative endeavors — and addressing society’s most pressing challenges, from healthcare to education to climate change and climate science.
We'll keep sharing our breakthroughs on our Google Research blog, at conferences and at other events. We're eager to explore — and invent — the future alongside all the partners and communities we work with."

Our Machine Learning Crash Course goes in depth on generative AI,https://blog.google/technology/developers/machine-learning-crash-course/,"In 2018, Google’s Engineering Education team released Machine Learning Crash Course, a free, online 15-hour self-study course that teaches fundamental machine learning (ML) concepts and principles. Our goal was to democratize access to machine learning knowledge, so anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge could develop the core skills necessary to become an ML practitioner.
Six years later, the landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning has evolved significantly, with new technologies such as generative AI and large language models. But literacy in core ML concepts is still essential knowledge for anyone interested in building AI software, using AI tools or just better understanding how AI works.
To serve the needs of the next generation of AI developers and enthusiasts, we recently launched a completely reimagined version of Machine Learning Crash Course. The new course adds topics including large language models and AutoML, as well as expanded coverage of working with data and responsible AI.
With this update, we’ve also focused on making the course content more approachable and fun for beginners, incorporating a brand-new set of video explainers, interactive visualizations and real-world programming exercises."
Meet the students that are changing the world through technology,https://blog.google/technology/developers/meet-the-students-that-are-changing-the-world-through-technology/,"Each year, the Google for Developers Solution Challenge empowers university students from around the world to leverage their technical skills — and Google technology — to tackle one or more of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This annual challenge culminates in a live demo day featuring 10 selected teams, where three top prizes and one people’s choice award will be given out.
This year's winners, from South Korea, India and Nigeria, have harnessed technology in groundbreaking ways to help their communities. Let's meet the winners.

South Korea faces an escalating dementia crisis fueled by its rapidly aging population. With an estimated 786,000 cases in 2021 and projections of continued growth in the coming decades, the country urgently needs innovative solutions to address this pressing issue.
A team of students from South Korea's Pukyong National University took on this challenge, focusing on two critical issues faced by individuals with mild dementia due to memory loss: difficulty recalling important life events and managing daily routines. Recognizing the progressive nature of memory loss in dementia, the team sought to enhance the quality of life for those affected. Their solution, ATTI, is a mobile app featuring a friendly voice assistant designed to help individuals with mild dementia manage memory loss.
The app, developed using Flutter for broad user reach across Android and iOS platforms, leverages Firebase for member management and feature development. By incorporating Google Cloud features and Gemini API, the team created the chatbot dialog feature ""ATTI,"" which aims to enhance communication, foster psychological stability and support lifestyle patterns for those living with dementia."
Gemma 2 is now available to researchers and developers,https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-gemma-2/,"AI has the potential to address some of humanity's most pressing problems — but only if everyone has the tools to build with it. That's why earlier this year we introduced Gemma, a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. We’ve continued to grow the Gemma family with CodeGemma, RecurrentGemma and PaliGemma — each offering unique capabilities for different AI tasks and easily accessible through integrations with partners like Hugging Face, NVIDIA and Ollama.
Now we’re officially releasing Gemma 2 to researchers and developers globally. Available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes, Gemma 2 is higher-performing and more efficient at inference than the first generation, with significant safety advancements built in. In fact, at 27B, it offers competitive alternatives to models more than twice its size, delivering the kind of performance that was only possible with proprietary models as recently as December. And that’s now achievable on a single NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU or TPU host, significantly reducing deployment costs.
We built Gemma 2 on a redesigned architecture, engineered for both exceptional performance and inference efficiency. Here’s what makes it stand out:"
